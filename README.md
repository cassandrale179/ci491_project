## 2. Contributing
- Do NOT write code directly onto the main branch. Please set up a new branch in which the first two letters are your initial, and
the name after that is the feature you are working on.
```bash
git checkout -b ml-firebase
```
- Open a Pull Request, so we can code-review together and merge it to the main branch.
